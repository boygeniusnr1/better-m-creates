        Join us at Tāhunanui School for a fun and eco-friendly clothing swap event!
        This is a fantastic opportunity for students, parents, and local community
        members to refresh their wardrobes sustainably. Bring your gently used clothes
        and discover new-to-you treasures from others. It's a perfect way to promote
        circular fashion and reduce textile waste in our community.

        Note: This event will be mainly focused on children's clothing, but all ages are welcome to participate.
