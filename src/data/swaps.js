        Join us at Tāhunanui School for a fun and eco-friendly clothing swap event!
        This is a fantastic opportunity for students, parents, and local community
        members to refresh their wardrobes sustainably. Bring your gently used clothes
        and discover new-to-you treasures from others. It's a perfect way to promote
        circular fashion and reduce textile waste in our community.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll have volunteers on hand to help guide you through the process and answer
        any questions you might have. Light refreshments will be provided. Come and be
        part of the Clothes Swap Society movement!
