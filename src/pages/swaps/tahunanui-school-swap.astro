  Join us at TƒÅhunanui School for a fun and eco-friendly clothing swap event!
  This is a fantastic opportunity for students, parents, and local community
  members to refresh their wardrobes sustainably. Bring your gently used clothes
  and discover new-to-you treasures from others. It's a perfect way to promote
  circular fashion and reduce textile waste in our community.
